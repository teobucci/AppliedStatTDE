# Variance components
#--------------------
# One thing that's new compared to the standard regression output is the estimated 
# variance/standard deviation of the school effect.
# This tells us how much, on average, achievement bounces around as we move from school to school. 
# In other words, even after making a prediction based on student covariates, each school has its
# own unique deviation, and that value (in terms of the standard deviation) is the estimated 
# average deviation across schools.
